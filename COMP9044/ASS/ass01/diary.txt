Design of my .shrug
0)general idea
Create three folder called: index, version, deleted_files, under the folder ".shrug", which used to store the file under different situations.

1)detailed of each shrug-*
[0]shrug-init
when inititalized .shrug, create folder ".shrug", under ".shrug" create  index, version, deleted_files. 

Error check: the exist of ".shrug"; the number of input argument

[1]shrug-add
move the files given from argument to the folder "index"

Error check: the exist of ".shrug"; the input with "-"; the file name beyond [a-zA-Z0-9.-_]; the input file exist or not

[2]shrug-commit
move the file from index to version(repo), if the version same as previous version, rm latest version

Error check: the exist of ".shrug"; the number of input argument; the first argument same as "-m"; the input file name without "-"; if there is no change to index; 

[3]shrug-show
show the file in index or specified file in version(repo)

Error check: the exist of ".shrug"; the given argument must with ":"; the number of input argument; the given file not exist; the given version not exist; the file name not legal; 

[4]shrug-log
show the number and comment in the folder "version"

Error check: the exist of ".shrug"; the number of input argument; 

[5]shrug-rm
ues flag to test the argument "--cached", "--force", rm the file from the index if "--cached" exist, rm the file from both current and index, if "--cached" not exist, rm the file without given any error if "--force" exists, after rm any files, make a copy to the deleted file to track these files status.

Error check: the exist of ".shrug", the argument same as "--cached" and "--force"; the exist of file which about to delete; the change of the file without add to ".shrug"; 

[6]shrug-status
build function different(), check_exist() to help check the status the file, use folder "deleted_files" to track the file which have already been deleted in current folder. 
show the file according different situation
#a - file changed, different changes staged for commit
#b - file changed, changes staged for commit
#c - file changed, changes not staged for commit
#d - file deleted
#e - deleted
#f - same as repo
#g - added to index
#h - untracked
#i - added to index, file changed
#j - added to index, file deleted

Error check: the exist of ".shrug"; the number of input argument; check the first commit have been added;
