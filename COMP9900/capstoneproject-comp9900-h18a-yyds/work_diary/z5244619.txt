Week1
Along with the team, I chose MyRecipes as our project. Then I participated in
the project kick off meeting and discussed about the tech stack our team might
be using with the project. I helped clarifying the project objectives as well as
the frontend interfaces.

Week2
I developed the prototype of the frontend and created user stories as was
planned since our last meeting. My tasks for week3 are:
a) Complete the background section for the project proposal
b) Start adding pages to the react framework that Zanning built

Week3
I finished the background, as was planned last week, as well as the storyboards
of the project proposal. Together with the rest of our frontend group, I
finished finalising our user interfaces and crucial routes. My tasks for week4
are:
a) Start working on sprint1

Week4
I built the ui for personal news feed page, and the logic of user updating
password. The plan for next week is to bring logic into personal feed page
and connect to the server, including retrieving personal recommendations
and personal feed, and most importantly, sort the feed.

Week5
I finished sorting the feed. I also built the ui for recipe details and the
logic for fetching data from the server. The task for the next week is to work
on the styling of recipe detail.

Week7
I finalised the recipe detail page and fixed login issues as well as implemented
message popups where necessary.

Week8
I fixed bugs on rating and commenting on a recipe, redesigned the carousel
on feed page and connected the carousel page and the recommended users to the
server.

Week9
I finished the final touch on the UI, including the font, the landing page, the
loader and the header. And together with other team members, I finished writing
the project report.
